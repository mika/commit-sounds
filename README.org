* Project Idea

[[http://programming-motherfucker.com/][Programming is fun]], except for when it isn't.
Install commit-sounds to at least make committing in Git more fun.

* System requirements

+ git
+ mplayer

* Usage instructions

Check out this repository:

   : BASEPATH=$(pwd)
   : git clone git://github.com/mika/commit-sounds.git

Create configuration file with SOUNDDIR pointing to the directory including the sound files:

   : mkdir -p ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-${HOME}/.config}/commit-sounds/
   : echo "SOUNDDIR=\"${BASEPATH}/commit-sounds/sounds/\"" >> ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-${HOME}/.config}/commit-sounds/defaults

Create a test repository for playing around:

   : git init /tmp/playground

Install the commit hook in the git repository:

   : cp commit-sounds/git/hooks/commit-msg /tmp/playground/.git/hooks/

Test hook, like:

   : cd /tmp/playground
   : echo test > TODO
   : git add TODO ; git commit -m 'add test to TODO file'

Or like:

   : echo fork > TODO
   : git commit -a -m 'improve and fork it!'

Fun? Install and use with a realâ„¢ repository.

If you're aware of any free distributable sound files that would fit its purpose and could be shipped as part of commit-sounds please report to the author.

Fork this project and file a pull request for your own keywords, further commit hooks,... I can't await to "Test" it.
